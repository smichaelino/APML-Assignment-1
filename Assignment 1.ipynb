    "For the first assignment of the course Applications of Machine Learning (INFOB3APML), you will learn to use decision tree, random forest, and isolation forest to detect an outlier class. The objectives of this assignment are:\n",
    "- use the supervised classification algorithms to classify outliers in real-life data sets\n",
    "- perform cross validation and fine-tune the model parameters of each algorithm\n",
    "- use the unsupervised outlier detection algorithms to detect outliers in real-life data sets\n",
    "- calculate model performance (e.g., accuracy, recall, precision, f1)\n",
    "- design experiments to compare performance of algorithms\n",
    "- reflect on the difference between different models\n",

    "This assignment includes three algorithms: DT, RF, and IF. The first task is to perform data exploration. In Task 2-4, you will use the three algorithms to classify outliers, respectively. In Task 5, you will compare the algorithms and evaluate their results. Please note that Task 2-4 have the following structure:\n",
    "1. First, find the library (e.g., sklearn examples) and try out the algorithm by simply training the model on the training data (do not consider any parameters or cross validation just yet); \n",
    "2. Train the model with the training data by using cross validation and find the best parameter setting for the parameters of interest;\n",
    "3. Report the average validation accuracy, recall, precision, and F1 scores of all validation sets;\n",
    "4. Finally, test the optimal model that has the best fitting parameters on your (held-out) test data, and report the test accuracy, precision, recall, and F1. \n",
